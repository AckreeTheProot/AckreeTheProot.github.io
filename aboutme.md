# Hello again! My name is Mithun Roy
I am a Bangladeshi-American 18 year old freshman studying Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University down in Pittsburgh, PA

# Online, I am known as Ackree
Much of what I do online is volunteering with robotics communities, whether it be giving advice to many local and international FIRST robotics teams, or working on electronic cosplays with other makers.
