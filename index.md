# Hello! I am Mithun Roy / Ackree, a current ECE major at Carnegie Mellon University
## I am currently looking into obtaining experience within Mechatronics or Hardware Design.

Across my page, you can find info regarding who I am, my experiences and projects, alongside my own hobbies. This website is a mesh of both my physical and online networks due to the amount of overlap with all I do.
